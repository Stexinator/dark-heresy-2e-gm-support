# Dark Heresy 2e GM Support

This module is meant to reduce some workload for GMs.

At this time it can:
- detect if a crit is applied to an actor and output the result from a corresponding table
  - for this the tables need to be named in the pattern of "type - body part" e.g. "Energy - Head"
- rolls automatically psychic phenomena
  - for this a table named 'Psychic Phenomena' needs to exist
    - I suggest making the last entry 75 - 750 that references a 'Perils of the Warp' table, this module does not automate this behaviour
  - warp conduit (talent and perils of the warp result) are not supported due to errors in the system
